    <h1>Wildcats</h1>
    <p>I'm going to teach you all about wildcats. First, the important stuff:</p>
<p>Wildcats are versatile creatures that can live in <span class="important">many different climates</span>. They can live in <span class="cat-climate">the jungle</span>, <span class="cat-climate">the mountains</span>, and even <span class="cat-climate">the desert</span>. Look carefully, and you may find one in <span class="important">your own backyard</span>!</p>
